# Parallelogram_Calculator
A small python project that performs calculations on parallelograms
This is one of my first python projects. It was inspired by one of Free Code Camp's challenges that asked one to
creata a Rectangle class and a subclass Square Class. This python code would  compute the area, perimeter, and diagonal length of a rectangle or square shape inputted by the user. It also displays a picture of the shape provided that the shape's height or width is not larger than 50.
